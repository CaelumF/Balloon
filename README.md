# Balloon

The Balloon engine is a 3D, physics based MMO engine written in Kotlin. Balloon has 3 goals:

1)To be Social. It should be able to  connect many players in the same world with minimum costs on performance

2)Scalability. It should scale efficiently, and with few limitations. It should support realistically scaled worlds.

3)Exstensibility. Developing with Balloon should be easy and non-convoluted. The API should be consistent and well-documented and developers should not need to repeat themselves
